//! Acquisition stage — per-slice k-space: EPI geometric distortion, T2* relaxation, eddy
//! currents, Nyquist ghosting, partial Fourier, Gibbs ringing, spikes, multi-coil combine, and
//! GRAPPA. Faithful port of the core DFT in `Algorithms/itkKspaceImageFilter.cpp:452`:
//!
//! ```text
//! kspace[kx,ky] = (1/N) Σ_{x,y} f(x,y)·exp( i·2π·( kx·x + ky·y + φ ) ),   φ = fmap(x,y)·t(ky)
//! image[x,y]    =        Σ_{kx,ky} kspace[kx,ky]·exp( -i·2π·( kx·x + ky·y ) )
//! ```
//! `f = Σ_c comp_c · exp(-tRf/T2_c − |t|/tInhom) · signal_scale`. The `φ = fmap·t(ky)` term (the
//! readout time increases with the PE line) is what warps EPI along the phase-encode axis — the
//! same physics that makes AP/PA reverse-PE pairs distort oppositely (the DRBUDDI/topup target).
//!
//! The transform is exact — the literal O(N³) sum, not an approximation of it — so it stays
//! directly comparable against Fiberfox. It is organised for speed without changing a term: the
//! per-line factors are split into static (hoisted), affine-in-ky (advanced by per-voxel rotors),
//! per-line scalars (relaxation) and per-axis separable (the eddy polynomial), leaving an inner
//! loop of complex multiply-adds; the x-DFT of each line and the 2-D reconstruction are FFTs
//! (`rustfft`, behind the `kspace` feature) or twiddle-table sums (default, std-only) — same
//! numbers either way (`restructured_forward_matches_the_literal_sum`,
//! `fft_inverse_matches_the_direct_dft`). Under `kspace` the y-sum with the fieldmap is also
//! O(N log N): read as geometry it is a source warp `y − sny·τ·fmap`, evaluated by a type-1
//! NUFFT (`nufft.rs`, ~1e-13); only the legacy gradient-model eddy polynomial, whose time profile
//! is not affine in ky, keeps the O(N³) rotor path.
